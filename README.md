=========

Pre/post processing utilities for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model.

#ISSUES

- Reconfigure plot output (support for shaded regions, decide on time scale).

- Integrate with WECC portfolio projections. 

- Visual disparity between observed and modeled solar irradiance in Colorado Basin.

- Bad correlations for several validation stations. Possibly increase routing model resolution. 

- Several recirculating plants in 'wauna' basin for which there is no water temperature output.
